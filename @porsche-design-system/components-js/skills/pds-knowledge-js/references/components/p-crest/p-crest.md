# p-crest

The `p-crest` gives the Porsche brand a distinctive look, sets it apart from others within the overall external image and represents the quality of the product.

> **Usage hint**
>
> This component shall only be used on viewports below 480px (breakpoint "S"). Otherwise, [p-wordmark](../p-wordmark/p-wordmark.md) has to be used.

You can use native `click`, `focus`, `focusin`, `blur` and `focusout` events on the `p-crest`.

## Usage

### Do:

- Use the [Wordmark](../p-wordmark/p-wordmark.md) as the main brand identifier.
- Use the crest only as an additional small brand identifier (e.g., within contact cards).
- Switch from the wordmark to the crest on small viewports below 480px (automatically implemented in global navigation and footer).

### Don't:

- Use the crest as the primary brand identifier by default.

## Accessibility support

### ARIA enhancements

#### External **ARIA** provided by the `aria` property:

| ARIA | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-label` | Defines a string value that labels the interactive element. |
| `aria-current` | Exposes the current state of the link. |
| `aria-haspopup` | Defines that the link opens a popup (e.g. `dialog`). |

## Development considerations

### Common do's and don'ts

- **Do** pass ARIA attributes through the `aria` prop when the crest is linked.
- **Do** provide a descriptive `aria-label` for linked crests, for example "Porsche home".
- **Don't** add native `aria-*` attributes directly on the component host.

## Integration examples

See [accessibility integration examples](./accessibility.md) for paired anti-pattern and recommended implementations.
