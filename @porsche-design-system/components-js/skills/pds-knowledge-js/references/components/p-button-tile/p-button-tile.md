# p-button-tile

The `p-button-tile` is an interactive component that displays a provided image to tease content and performs form or **interaction** events within one container. Whenever you want to provide navigational elements, stick to the [Link Tile](../p-link-tile/p-link-tile.md) component instead.

**Note:** The component does not take care of processing and aligning the image.

An `<img/>`, `<picture/>` or `<video/>` tag has to be provided as default slot.

Additionally, the properties `description` and `label` are required. The `description` property is used as a teaser with a more detailed description of the button and its action.

The `label` property is used to describe the button.

## Usage

### Do:

- Use Button Tile for **on-page interactivity**.
- Use [Link Tile](../p-link-tile/p-link-tile.md) instead if you want to **navigate** to another page.
- Use Button Tile with appropriate aspect ratios and short descriptions (80 characters or fewer).
- Use basic Button Tile for better perception tests and compact Button Tile for improved spacing (especially on mobile).
- Use gradient Button Tile when image contrast is insufficient and select images with natural contrast.
- Use font size for visual hierarchy and customize image type and font size for responsiveness.
- Use engaging verbs and product names in compact Button Tile.
- Create assets upfront for image processing.

### Don't:

- Don't manipulate images, keep them natural and contrasted.
- Don't write long descriptions that overflow content (especially on mobile).

## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state | Function |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |
| `Enter`, `Space` | Activates the button. |
| `disabled` | Button still focusable. |

### ARIA enhancements

#### External **ARIA** provided by the `aria` property:

| ARIA | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-label` | Defines a string value that labels an interactive element. It's required for buttons with `hideLabel="true"`. |
| `aria-description` | Defines a string value that adds a more detailed description of the interactive element. |
| `aria-expanded` | Exposes a visual state (e.g. expanded/collapsed) of another element. |
| `aria-pressed` | Exposes the `pressed` state of a toggle button. |
| `aria-haspopup` | Defines that the button opens a popup (e.g. `dialog`). It can be used in combination with `aria-expanded` to indicate the state of the popup. |

## Limitations

Due to the nature of **Web Components** and **shadow DOM**, there are limitations when using some **ARIA** attributes to define relationships between elements across different shadow DOMs or shadow DOM/light DOM combinations.

| ARIA | Support |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-labelledby` | 🚫 |
| `aria-describedby` | 🚫 |
| `aria-owns` | 🚫 |
| `aria-controls` | 🚫 |
| `aria-activedescendant` | 🚫 |

## Development considerations

### Labelling

If the text of the button does not clearly indicate what the button's function is, add a brief, descriptive label using the `aria` property with the `aria-label` value to provide more context for screen reader users. Phrases like "Detail" or "Open" can be unclear when read out of context by a screen reader. In such instances, provide an alternative text that offers more detailed information, such as "Open details of product XYZ."

### Common do's and don'ts

- **Do** pass ARIA attributes via the `aria` prop when the visible label needs more context.
- **Do** provide a descriptive `label` that explains the tile action.
- **Do** add `aria-label` on slotted `<video>` elements used as backgrounds.
- **Don't** add native `aria-*` attributes directly on the component host.

## Integration examples

See [accessibility integration examples](./accessibility.md) for paired anti-pattern and recommended implementations.

## API

### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `align` | `'top'` `'bottom'` | `'bottom'` | Controls the vertical placement of the description and button — `top` or `bottom`. |
| `aria` | `ButtonTileAriaAttribute` | `undefined` | Sets ARIA attributes on the tile's action button to improve accessibility for screen readers. |
| `aspectRatio` | `'1/1'` `'4/3'` `'3/4'` `'16/9'` `'9/16'` `'auto'`<br>`BreakpointCustomizable<ButtonTileAspectRatio>` | `'4/3'` | Sets the width-to-height ratio of the tile media area. Supports responsive breakpoint values. |
| `compact` | `boolean`<br>`BreakpointCustomizable<boolean>` | `false` | Renders only the icon button without the full label. Supports responsive breakpoint values. |
| `description` _(required)_ | `string` | `undefined` | Sets the description text displayed in the tile's content area. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables the tile, preventing button interaction. |
| `gradient` | `boolean` | `false` | Shows a gradient overlay over the media slot to improve text legibility on bright images or videos. |
| `icon` | `'none'`<br>one of 293 icon names — see [icon names](references/icons.md) | `'none'` | Sets the icon displayed in the tile's action button. Use `none` to show no icon. |
| `iconSource` | `string` | `undefined` | Sets a path to a custom SVG icon for the action button, used instead of the built-in icon set. |
| `label` _(required)_ | `string` | `undefined` | Sets the accessible label text of the action button rendered inside the tile. |
| `loading` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables the tile and shows a loading spinner to indicate an ongoing operation. |
| `size` | `'medium'` `'large'` `'inherit'`<br>`BreakpointCustomizable<ButtonTileSize>` | `'medium'` | Sets the font size of the description text in the tile content area. Supports responsive breakpoint values. |
| `type` | `'button'` `'submit'` `'reset'` | `'submit'` | Sets the button's HTML type — `submit` sends the form, `reset` clears it, `button` performs no default action. |
| `weight` | `'regular'` `'semi-bold'`<br>`BreakpointCustomizable<ButtonTileWeight>` | `'semi-bold'` | Sets the font weight of the description text in the tile content area. Supports responsive breakpoint values. |

### Slots

| Slot | Required | Allowed tag names | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `header` | no | — | Renders a header section above the content area. |
| _(default)_ | no | — | Default slot for the img or picture tag. |
| `footer` | no | — | Renders a footer section below the description. |

## Examples

| Example | When to use | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | Minimal default configuration. | [./examples/Default.html](./examples/Default.html) |
| UI behaviour | The component is able to break out of its aspect ratio in case content overflows to be accessibility compliant (see first row in example). | [./examples/UiBehaviour.html](./examples/UiBehaviour.html) |
| Hyphens | It is possible to overwrite the hyphens style on the host element and use 'soft' hyphens. | [./examples/Hyphens.html](./examples/Hyphens.html) |
| Footer slot | You can also use a `footer` slot to display additional text below the description, providing more flexibility for custom content. | [./examples/FooterSlot.html](./examples/FooterSlot.html) |
| Color scheme | The component defines `color-scheme: dark` internally, independently of the scheme defined globally or on an ancestor outside the Button Tile. | [./examples/ColorScheme.html](./examples/ColorScheme.html) |
